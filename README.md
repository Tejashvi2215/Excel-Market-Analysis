A market analysis dashboard is a dynamic and comprehensive tool designed to provide a clear and insightful overview of market strategies. This interactive dashboard integrates various elements such as pivot tables, slicers, and conditional tools to facilitate easy visualization and analysis. The goal of this dashboard is to streamline the complex market data into a user-friendly interface, making it accessible and comprehensible for stakeholders.
